        <h1>What does Que represent?"
            <p>It represents simplicity. A certain energy passed on to others that's equivalent to Happiness & Love.
                        It means the deepest infatuation with life and what it has to offer in every aspect. It's the 
                        being of one, knowing the process of growth and what you want that one to become. One evolving 
                    into a better person mentally, physically & spiritually. When one isn't phased or hindered by past 
                situations or current. Being comfortable regardless of the circumstances around them.</p>
